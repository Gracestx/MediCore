# MediCore üè•

A decentralized medical records management system built on Stacks blockchain that empowers patients to control access to their health data while enabling secure healthcare provider collaboration.

## Overview

MediCore revolutionizes healthcare data management by providing patients with complete ownership and control over their medical records. Healthcare providers can request access to specific records, and patients can grant time-limited permissions with different access levels.

## Key Features

- **Patient-Controlled Access**: Patients own and control all access to their medical records
- **Emergency Access Protocol**: Critical medical situations allow authorized providers emergency access with proper governance
- **Verified Healthcare Providers**: Only verified medical professionals can access records
- **Time-Limited Permissions**: Access grants expire automatically for enhanced security
- **Granular Access Levels**: Different permission levels (read, write, full) for various use cases
- **Emergency Access Logging**: Complete audit trail of all emergency access events
- **Cooldown Protection**: Prevents abuse of emergency access with mandatory waiting periods
- **Immutable Audit Trail**: All access grants and revocations are permanently recorded
- **Privacy-First Design**: Only encrypted hashes are stored on-chain, not actual medical data
