# MediCore üè•

A decentralized medical records management system built on Stacks blockchain that empowers patients to control access to their health data while enabling secure healthcare provider collaboration.

## Overview

MediCore revolutionizes healthcare data management by providing patients with complete ownership and control over their medical records. Healthcare providers can request access to specific records, and patients can grant time-limited permissions with different access levels.

## Key Features

- **Patient-Controlled Access**: Patients own and control all access to their medical records
- **Verified Healthcare Providers**: Only verified medical professionals can access records
- **Time-Limited Permissions**: Access grants expire automatically for enhanced security
- **Granular Access Levels**: Different permission levels (read, write, full) for various use cases
- **Immutable Audit Trail**: All access grants and revocations are permanently recorded
- **Privacy-First Design**: Only encrypted hashes are stored on-chain, not actual medical data

## Smart Contract Functions

### For Patients
- `create-record`: Store a new medical record hash
- `grant-access`: Allow a healthcare provider to access a specific record
- `revoke-access`: Remove access permissions from a provider
- `update-record`: Update an existing medical record
- `deactivate-record`: Permanently deactivate a record

### For Healthcare Providers
- `register-provider`: Register as a healthcare provider
- `get-record`: Access medical records (if permissions granted)
- `check-access`: Verify access permissions to a record

### For Contract Owner
- `verify-provider`: Verify healthcare provider credentials

## Record Types Supported
